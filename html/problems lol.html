Behind the images of the fusion pokemon in the evolution chart it would be cool to have a shadow underneath looks 
like a puddle, could be linked to the type of the pokemon - out of scope do later lol

        4. Check types match the wikis exceptions for things like normal flying type and specific pokemon. 

        3. make pokeball throw animation quicker / be able to disable animation

        //MOLLY SUGGESTIONS

done    //margin between evolve chart and moves learned by level up e.g salamence and charizard

done    // name of pokemon below circle

done    //centre image within the circle

done    //Increase the size of the pokeball to match ~ the size of the background for the fusion pokemon. 
        dont really like this change tbh

done    //add span text "pokemon-number", make it either smaller or less bold.

done    //Add column break between rows on moves learned by level up columns => col-right-moves
        
done    //bullet point the location list - maybe use pokeballs as the bullet point - 
        otherwise try with horizontal breaks between elements.

        //add footer, what information do i add tho idk. disclaimer / thanks for looking at my website. / back to top?

done    //try make the head and body location data line breaks the same width as the move line breaks

        //make animations keep count so when moving between pages either the animations
        start again or nonused animations start at the same point as current animation timer.

ask     //Should the title "Location" even be on the page?

done    //add text to denote hidden abilities

done    //fix background of main content

done    //FIX - Make a row for the arrow and have the arrow above the evolve text the evolve text should be ontop of the below evolution b-evolve -->
